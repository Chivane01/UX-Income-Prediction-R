# üéØ UX Funnel & Income Prediction using R

This project simulates user behavior across a digital product funnel and applies statistical analysis and logistic regression to predict income categories. It demonstrates core data skills including exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, visualization, and modeling ‚Äî tailored for UX and product analytics roles.

---

## üìò Project Objectives

- Analyze user age, education, and behavioral patterns
- Simulate funnel stages (Landing ‚Üí Purchase) and evaluate drop-offs
- Predict income class (>50K vs <=50K) using logistic regression
- Visualize user behavior and deliver product-facing insights

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **R v4.4.1**
- `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `corrplot`, `pROC`
- Synthetic dataset (generated within R)
- Visual outputs saved using `ggsave()`

---

## üìä Key Analyses

### üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution analysis for `Age`, `Education_num`, `hours_per_week`
- Funnel stage behavior visualized across 5 key journey points
- Income distribution across demographic and behavioral features
- Correlation analysis across numeric predictors

### üìà Hypothesis Testing
- 1-sample t-tests (Age vs 40, Hours-per-week vs 35)
- 2-sample t-tests (Hours by income, Education by gender)
- ANOVA tests (Age vs Work Class, Capital Gain vs Marital Status)

### üî¢ Logistic Regression
- Target: `income_binary` (1 = >50K, 0 = <=50K)
- Features: Age, Education_num, Hours-per-week, Capital Gain
- ROC Curve & AUC to evaluate predictive power

## üñºÔ∏è Sample Visualizations

These are stored in the `Visuals/` folder:

- `age_distribution.png`
- `funnel_stages.png`
- `roc_curve.png`
- `correlation_matrix.png`

---

## üìÅ Dataset

- Simulated dataset: [`simulated_ux_income_dataset.csv`](data/simulated_ux_income_dataset.csv)
- Created using `data.frame()` and standard distributions
- No external dependencies ‚Äî reproducible from R code

## üìå Final Outcomes & Takeaways

| Metric                | Finding                                              |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Age distribution      | Majority of users are 25‚Äì45 years old                |
| Education & income    | Education_num > 10 is strongly linked to >50K income |
| Capital gain & income | >300 capital gain is a strong predictor              |
| Model performance     | Logistic regression AUC = 0.979                      |
| Funnel drop-offs      | Highest at 'Browse' and 'AddToCart' stages           |

### üîç Additional Insights

- Gender differences in education level were not statistically significant
- Work class had minimal influence on age or income in ANOVA
- Most users earn <=50K, indicating class imbalance ‚Äî important for modeling

## üß≠ Improvement Opportunities (Problem-Side)

- Reduce mid-funnel drop-offs (especially at 'Browse' and 'AddToCart') through clearer UI, trust signals, and faster load times
- Optimize content on product detail pages to better engage users transitioning from 'Signup'
- Personalize user experience based on age and education-level segments to guide higher-propensity users
- Introduce behavioral nudges like limited-time offers or social proof to influence conversion at 'AddToCart'
- Implement real-time income prediction to dynamically adjust recommendations or offers
